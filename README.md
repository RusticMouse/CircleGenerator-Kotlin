# CircleGenerator

This Kotlin program generates circles that you can print and enjoy. You can create circles with customizable properties.

## Features

- Create cirlces with a specified number of the radius of the circle.
- Customize the decoration of the circle with your choice of characters.

### Creating a Circle

To create a cirlce with a specified radius of the circle using the default decoration (asterisks `*`), you can use the `drawCircle` method:

```kotlin
drawCricle(5,"*")
```

## Printing the Circle
You can then print the generated circle using println() or save it to a file.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use programm to create a circle:
```kotlin
 fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        drawCircle(100, ".")
    }
```
This will generate and print a circle with a radius of 5 using asterisks as decoration.

## Disclaimer

The circle will not look perlectly round in a standard text file, due to the representation of the text editor.
